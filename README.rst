respy for MA
============

This repository contains a copy of respy at the time I wrote my master's thesis.
It is for replication purposes. Everyone else should use the real respy.

The important versions in this repository are

- `kw2000` to simulate the choice probabilties for Keane and Wolpin (2000)
- `one-step-ahead-simulation` to provide the within-sample wage fits
- `better-clipping` to perform the estimations
